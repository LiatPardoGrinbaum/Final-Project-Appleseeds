Appleseeds Final Project

This project was taken as a part of my participance in Appleseed academy fullstack bootcamp, and is my first full stack
mern project.

## Description

The website is a place for people to share their tips for better life in 6 different categories.  
Users can sign up or log in to the website with their authenticated details, and have a profile page which they can see
their own tips, edit or delete them. They also can delete or update their account.  
After Login, all categories are shown on home page, and the user can choose which category's tips he\she would like to
see.  
In every category page, all the category's tips are shown. The user can rate the tip by clicking the "like" icon, or
view the content of the tip by clicking the title's link.

## Technologies

- Frontend: HTML, CSSS (SASS), ReactJS.
- Backend: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Amazon S3 storage service.
- Heroku deployment

## Challenges along the way:

In order to implement all the features I wanted to have in this project, I had to learn new subjects such as
authentication and authorization, file upload, s3 amazon storage service.  
The main difficulty I had in this project was to figure out why heroku wasn't showing well the images the users uploaded
or updated, after new deployment. I finally figured out the necessary of external cloud services and learn how to save
my files in amazon's s3 storage service.
